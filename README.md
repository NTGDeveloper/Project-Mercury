(insert picture logo)

Project Mercury is a new, ambitious project from NTG Developer.



## What This Is

Project Mercury is an Android application that provides an easy countdown interface to let users see how many days it will take until an event occurs. The app is fully local and does not require the Internet, as it is based on local frameworks built in to Android.

The app may eventually integrate with a local calendar using local sync services that are shared from either Google Calendar, Outlook, etc. The app does not use any cloud data, and only interacts with the local phone.

## Upcoming Features List

- [ ] Make an actual demo app
